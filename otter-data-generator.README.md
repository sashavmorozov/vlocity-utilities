## Salesforce Industries Sample Data Generator (Orders and Assets)

This tool simplifies the creation of sample data tailored to the Salesforce Industries product catalog. While not a one-click solution, it provides clear instructions to guide you through generating and submitting customer orders. You'll need to patiently execute anonymous Apex methods and set up a few custom classes, with all references provided. Currently, the tool supports customer orders onlyâ€”quotes are not yet supported. To get started, you'll first need to create template customer orders, which will be cloned, submitted to COM, and assetized.

The tool is not tailored to clone ESM multi-site orders yet. Think about simpler single site orders.

## Required Classes

Take these classes and create them in your org (vlocity_cmt package is required, Comms IDO is a good org example)
* UUIDGenerator
* OtterXOMOrderUtils
* OtterDataGenerator

## Required Config

* Product catalog for your use case
* Orchestration scenarios for your use case (should include assetization step)

## Process

### Create a set of template customer orders
The data will be generated based on template customer orders: they will be cloned, submitted to COM and pushed to the assetization (see next steps). But you will need to create customer order templates yourself first. For that you will need a product catalog already set up (I assume this is already done).

1. Create a template customer account
2. Create a customer order
3. Open CPQ and add whatever products you need to represent what a customer typically orders
4. You can add promotions, override pricing, etc. This should work just fine
5. Do not submit this order, just leave it in draft, copy order Salesforce ID (e.g. `801d1000001owWbAAI`) into a notepad
6. Repeat steps 2-5 to create as many order templates as you need (e.g. separate templates for different flavors of internet, mobile, cloud, etc.)

### Update OtterDataGenerator with the created IDs
At this moment, the IDs are hardcoded into the class. Not fantastic but this is a quick and dirty approach to get started. Later on this may be taken out into a configuration. For now, you need to update the class:

1. Open the class
2. Look fot this piece of code and replace the IDs with the IDs from your template orders

```js
List<String> orderTemplateIds = new List<String> {
                '801d1000001owWbAAI',
                '801d1000001owWcAAI',
                '801d1000001p56mAAA'

            };
```
 3. Save the updated class to your org
 4. We are ready to generate some data now

### Clone the orders using your templates
Run this piece of code as an anonymous Apex. This will create a number of new customer orders (for randomly selected accounts) using the templates you created. Today the max number of clones you can create in a single transaction is `20`. Not much but a good start.
If you need to create 1000 orders - execute this piece 50 times, sequencially. Do not try to wrap it into a for-loop, this will likely fail.

Creating 20 clones will take about 20 seconds. 

```js
/* 
 * Clone orders using a set of template orders 
 * Can support up to 20 new orders at this moment
 * Need more orders? Execute this method sequencially as many times as needed
 */
 
OtterDataGenerator.cloneOrder(20);
```

The output will look like this

You can now open the list of orders in your org, sort them by Order Number and check the results
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cc30e43-2e3a-4df5-937f-ce14c835acbc)

Make sure that `Fulfilment Status` of the new orders appear as `Draft`. This should work but if you see empty status - run the following piece of code. This can update 1000+ orders in one go.
```js
/* Run this after creating all clones, just in case
 * Sometimes cloning leaves very important fields empty ðŸ¤·
 */
OtterDataGenerator.fixFulfillmentStatus(); //just in case
```

### Submit cloned orders to Customer Order Management
To create assets, we will use standard capabilities of COM. Thus, the cloned orders have to be submitted to COM.
This method can accept up to 50 orders at a time. The method chooses ready-to-submit cloned orders and then push them into COM.
If you have 1000 orders - then execute this code 20 times.
The method itself take around 10 seconds to complete but it starts a set of new jobs that will be executed in background (takes longer)

```js
/*
 *
 * Submit cloned orders to COM
 * Async method, can accept up to 50 orders in one go but works quite quickly
 * Creates async apex jobs for each order to submit (up to 50 jobs at a time)
 * If you see the jobs failing - try to reexecute
 * Can execute as many times as you want
 */
List<Order> customerOrdersList = [select id, ordernumber from order where vlocity_cmt__OrderStatus__c = 'Ready To Submit' and PoNumber like 'Cloned Order%' limit 50];

System.debug('**** To be submitted: ' + customerOrdersList.size() + ' orders');
for (order o: customerOrdersList) {
    System.debug('****     Order: ' + o.OrderNumber + ' / ' + o.Id);
}

OtterDataGenerator.forceSubmitOrdersAsync(customerOrdersList);

```

Expected output
```
10:08:36.250 (6270492739)|USER_DEBUG|[3]|DEBUG|**** To be submitted: 20 orders
10:08:36.250 (6270750125)|USER_DEBUG|[5]|DEBUG|****     Order: 00001987 / 801d1000001pWQHAA2

10:08:36.250 (6270905599)|USER_DEBUG|[5]|DEBUG|****     Order: 00002006 / 801d1000001pWQaAAM

...
```

If everything works as expected, you will be able to see the list of orders **with a reference to an Orchestration Plan**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a158db53-013e-4f0f-b7cf-af201a78a1f8)

Two reasons I saw why it doesn't happen:
* Fulfilment Status on your orders is empty
* You request to run more than 50 processes at a time (request max 50)
* Or some background processes are not completed yet - wait a little before executing the code


### Force push to assetization
For every order - I expect you already have an orchestration plan that includes a step to assetize it. Can be partial or complete assetization - both are supported. If you don't have the process set up yet - return to the very beginning and set them up first.
This method just "pushes" the orchestration process to the assetization stage and let COM to execute assetization.

Technically, you can request to force assetize many orders at once (1000+) but sometimes COM struggles to execute mass assetization request. So, if you see errors - **reduce the limit in the query below**.
Keep executing this method until all your orders are completed and assetized

**IMPORTANT**: COM often struggles to assetize orders if an order contains multiple partial assetization steps.

```js
/*
 *
 * Forces creation of customer assets
 * Sync method, just updates the tasks and let the assetization to take care of asset creation
 * Can accept a lot of orders
 * Assetization tasks themselves can fail in COM due to a lot of such requests happening in parallel
 * If you still see failed tasks - try reducing the limit in the query below
 */
List<Order> customerOrdersList = [select id, ordernumber from order where vlocity_cmt__FulfilmentStatus__c = 'In Progress' and PoNumber like 'Cloned Order%' limit 50];
system.debug(customerOrdersList);

OtterDataGenerator.forceAssetizeOrders(customerOrdersList);
```

Expected output:
```

Ideally, in the list of orchestration plans, you will see all new orcehstration plans as `Completed`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5a11c4d-1ceb-4221-bf92-857326e51b36)

Ideally, in the list of assets, you will see all new assets created
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dadceff4-5e3e-48ae-9019-d9da02991964)

If you see some orchstration plans are still `In progress` - check the list of orchestration items. If there are errors like this - just run the code one (or more) times more. Until all the items are marked as `Completed`

## Grand Finale

That is it. You created a whole bunch of new orders, submitted them to COM and COM created lots of new assets. These assets can now be seen on the list of assets and within customer account as well. You can now use these assets for MACDs, reports and analytics, AI/ML, etc.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b645805-bc22-430c-8386-675d27407c2d)

To check the total number of assets, run this code:

```js
list<asset> at = [select id, name, vlocity_cmt__AssetReferenceId__c from asset where vlocity_cmt__AssetReferenceId__c = '309fa779-5122-46c0-847b-c63b157d6215'];
System.debug('*** Total number of assets: ' + at.size());
```

Expected outcome:
```
10:28:13.39 (84391374)|USER_DEBUG|[2]|DEBUG|*** Total number of assets: 1041
```


### Potential Simple Improvements:
1. Support quote cloning
2. Move out order template IDs out from the OtterDataGenerator

### Potential Advanced Improvements:
1. Use ESM quote cloning
2. Bulkify order cloning
3. Bulkify order submission (consider using ESM)
4. Support multi-site quotes and orders
